    "In this lab, I hope to gain proficiency in selecting, applying, and interpreting a variety of visual and statistical methods. Unlike in previous labs where I cleaned the Sacramento real estate transaction dataset and created visualizations and a data app, this lab presents a new challenge. Now I can employ statistical tests to uncover correlations and associations between different types of variables.\n",

Each house has info on the number of types of rooms, square footage, price, sale date, exact location, etc. This can be better used to understand the housing market in Sacramento, and may be applied elsewhere."

    "In this lab, I applied three essential statistical tests: Pearson's correlation, Chi-squared test of independence, and Kruskal-Wallis test. Pearson's correlation helped me uncover linear relationships between continuous variables. The Chi-squared test enabled me to assess the independence of categorical variables, revealing whether they are associated or not. Lastly, the Kruskal-Wallis test allowed me to examine how different property types relate to various continuous variables. Through these tests, I enhanced my ability to extract meaningful information from data."
